# News-Scraper

### Project Overview
This project was an assignment in the Northwestern Full Stack Coding Program. This project uses a node connection using MongoDb to manipulate Database data to create pull and store articles to comment on and read at your leasure. 

### Issues or other things to add
Some of the issues I had with this project was keeping my figuring out how to best display the content to the page. I wanted to be able to also pull the picture to the page, but I feel the website I chose used a very odd way of formatting their elements which made it diffucult to pull. The other issue I had was I did not know how to make the app not keep pulling duplicate articles. Somethings that would definitly be needed for a second attempt would be an article clear button to dump all artiles not flagged to be saved for later. 

## Getting Started
The application works in a simple setup, just by clicking the 'Pull Articles' button it will pull 10 of the top articles currently on Cracked.com with the Title a small discription of the article followed by a direct link to the full article. You may also click on any article title to open up a note textbox. This will attach to the article so that if you click it again your notes will persist.
